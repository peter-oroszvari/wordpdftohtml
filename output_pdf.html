Adobe Acrobat PDF Files
<br/>Adobe® Portable Document Format (PDF) is a universal file format that preserves all
<br/>of the fonts, formatting, colours and graphics of any source document, regardless of
<br/>the application and platform used to create it.
<br/>Adobe PDF is an ideal format for electronic document distribution as it overcomes the
<br/>problems commonly encountered with electronic file sharing.
<br/>• Anyone, anywhere can open a PDF file. All you need is the free Adobe Acrobat
<br/>Reader. Recipients of other file formats sometimes can't open files because they
<br/>don't have the applications used to create the documents.
<br/>• PDF files always print correctly on any printing device.
<br/>• PDF  files  always  display  exactly  as  created,  regardless  of  fonts,  software,  and
<br/>operating systems. Fonts, and graphics are not lost due to platform, software, and
<br/>version incompatibilities.
<br/>• The  free  Acrobat  Reader  is  easy  to  download  and  can  be  freely  distributed  by
<br/>anyone.
<br/>• Compact  PDF  files  are  smaller  than  their  source  files  and  download  a
<br/>page at a time for fast display on the Web.
